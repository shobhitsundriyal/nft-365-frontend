UNDER THE HOOD:
There are very few platforms that are using the concept of Dynamic NFTs. Ours is one of those few platforms that attempts to customize an NFT based on user preferences. 
The old and the new NFT reside on IPFS and there's an on-chain updation of the tokenURI aspect as well. This ensures that all data is transparent and the system is decentralized in nature.  

BRAND BOARD:

The website for each year would be archived but would be viewable by others. The calendar for an year also acts as a "brand board" wherein - if you are an event organizer, you can mint the date of your event and then add additional details about the event to customize the date. 

The brand board for the entire year would be visible on our platform. A great way to brand your event, isn't it?
